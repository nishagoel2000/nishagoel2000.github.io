		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p> My name is Nisha, and I am currently a sophomore at WPI. I am based in Boston, and in fact have lived in Massachusetts 
		my whole life! I have always loved to travel and hope to travel the world some day. I created this webpage to document and 
		share some of my experiences, and I hope to keep working on this to share more! Even though this particular website has only
		places in the United States, I have travelled outside the country, including various cities in Canada, India, and London. I 
		hope that you enjoy reading about my experiences and maybe you'll find my experiences helpful in planning a trip of your own! <br><br>
		Disclaimer: This is not an exhaustive list of the places that I have visited in the USA, but I hope to continue updating
		this website with more of my adventures. I have not been sponsored by any company at any of the locations mentioned on this 
		blog in any way.</p>
