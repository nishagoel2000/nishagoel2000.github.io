		<p> My name is Nisha, and I started this blog as a project in my sophomore year at WPI. I am based in Boston, and in fact 
		have lived in Massachusetts my whole life! I have always loved to travel and hope to travel the world some day. I created this
		webpage to document and share some of my experiences, and I hope to keep working on this to share more! I plan to document my 
		travels within the US and outside of the country. I hope that you enjoy reading about my experiences and maybe you'll find my 
		experiences helpful in planning a trip of your own! <br><br>
		Disclaimer: This is not an exhaustive list of the places that I have visited, but I hope to continue updating this website with 
		more of my adventures. I have not been sponsored by any company at any of the locations mentioned on this blog in any way.
