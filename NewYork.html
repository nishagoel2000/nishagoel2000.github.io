		<h3>My Experience</h3>
			<p>
			Living in Boston, I have been to New York City countless times, and I enjoy it every time. I will be sharing my most
			recent experience in New York City, which I spent with my friends and my family in December 2019.

			<p>
			Usually, when I go into the city, I go to Midtown Manhattan and spend most of my time around Times Square and the Empire State Building.
			One time, my family and I had a hotel room right in front of the Empire State building and we spent most of our time shopping and walking
			in the area. However, I met up with some friends who are locals of the area and was able to see more of New York City than just Times Square.
			We went to several parks, including Madison Square Park, Washington Square Park, and Union Square Park. We ate delicious Thai food at the 
			Thai Villa (pictured left) and drank hot chocalate at Amorino's Cafe (pictured right), and went to a bookstore, The Strand.

			Something that I will always love is the night life in New York City. Even the coldest day or latest hour couldn't change that, and this day
			was no exception. Despite the weather being less than 0 degrees Farenheit, people from all over were exploring Rockafeller during the holiday	
			season, taking pictures, spending time with family, and soaking in the lively holiday cheer. It was something that my family and I had been 
			hoping to do for a long time, as the last time we had gone to Rockafeller over the holidays was when I was very little, so I didn't remember it.

			<p>
			I still have a bucket list of places I want to visit in New York, such as the Vessel and going to a Broadway show, and there is also a number of places that 
			I have visited, but it has been years, such as the Statue of Liberty and Ground Zero. I have also been to Central Park and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 
			both incredible places that I recommend visiting. I haven't been there in years, but I know that it's worth going there at least once.
